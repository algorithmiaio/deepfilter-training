# DeepFilter Training

![DeepFilter Example](http://blog.algorithmia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gan_vogh_example2.png)

[DeepFilter](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/DeepFilter) is a fun way to convert photos or images into the style of a masterpiece painting, drawing, etc. For instance, you could apply the artistic style of Van Goghâ€™s Starry Night to an otherwise boring photo of the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.

This is a guide to help you get started in training your own DeepFilters.

## 1. Training DeepFilter

1. First of, you'll need a valid AWS account so you can start off by creating an EC2 `p2.xlarge` instance with our AMI image. (`ami-b19aafa6`)

2. Git clone this repository by using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/algorithmiaio/deepfilter-training.git`

3. Run the following command: `. deepfilter-training/install_environment.sh` to setup the environment for DeepFilter training. (installing may take up to an hour or two)

4. Change directory into `texture_nets` via the command `cd texture_nets`, and download a style image using the following command: `wget <url_to_image>`. Later rename the style image file via: `mv <image_filename> style.jpg`.

5. Start training via the command: `th train.lua -data dataset -style_image style.jpg -style_size 600 -image_size 512 -model johnson -batch_size 4 -learning_rate 1e-2 -style_weight 10 -style_layers relu1_2,relu2_2,relu3_2,relu4_2 -content_layers relu4_2`

Training will continue until it hits 50k iterations. You'll find all of your model files under the folder `data/checkpoints`.
