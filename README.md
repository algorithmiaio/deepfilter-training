# DeepFilter Training

![DeepFilter Example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/algorithmia-assets/github_repo/deepfilter-training/gan_vogh_example2.png)

[DeepFilter](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/DeepFilter) is a fun way to convert photos or images into the style of a masterpiece painting, drawing, etc. For instance, you could apply the artistic style of Van Goghâ€™s Starry Night to an otherwise boring photo of the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.

This is a guide to help you get started in training your own DeepFilters.

## 1. Training DeepFilter

1. First of, you'll need a valid AWS account so you can start off by creating an EC2 `P2.xlarge` instance with one of our AMI images (one image per region). `P2.xlarge` instances only exist in 3 regions: US-East-1 (Northern Virginia) `ami-b19aafa6`, US-West-2 (Oregon) `ami-5c2e823c` and EU-West-1 (Ireland) `ami-36461b45`.

2. SSH into your newly created server using the command: `ssh -i path/to/key.pem ubuntu@<server_public_ip_address>`

3. Git clone this repository by using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/algorithmiaio/deepfilter-training.git`

4. Run the following command: `. deepfilter-training/install_environment.sh` to setup the environment for DeepFilter training. (installing may take up to an hour or two)

5. Download a style image using the following command: `wget <url_to_image>`.

6. Rename the style image file via: `mv <image_filename> style.jpg`.

7. Start training via the command: `th train.lua -data dataset -style_image style.jpg -style_size 480 -image_size 480 -model johnson -batch_size 4 -learning_rate 1e-2 -style_weight 10 -style_layers relu1_2,relu2_2,relu3_2,relu4_2 -content_layers relu4_2`

![Iteration Example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/algorithmia-assets/github_repo/deepfilter-training/iteration_example.png)

Training will continue until it hits 50k iterations (takes up to 24 hrs). You'll find all of your model files under the folder `data/checkpoints`.

**Note:** You may play with the training settings to get different results. For more information regarding parameter optimization, please refer to:

* [DmitryUlyanov/texture_nets - Documentation](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/texture_nets/blob/master/README.md)
* [DmitryUlyanov/texture_nets - Issues regarding parameters](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/texture_nets/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20parameter).

## 2. Testing DeepFilter

1. Login to your algorithmia account with your API key via: `algo auth`

2. Create a new collection in your account to store your model file via: `algo mkdir .my/DeepFilterTraining`

3. Copy your 50k model file to new collection: `algo cp data/checkpoints/model_50000.t7 data://.my/DeepFilterTraining/my_model.t7`

4. Test your new model: `algo run deeplearning/DeepFilter/0.6.x -d '{"images": ["data://deeplearning/example_data/elon_musk.jpg"],"savePaths": ["data://.my/DeepFilterTraining/stylized.jpg"],"filterName": "data://.my/DeepFilterTraining/my_model.t7"}'`

5. View your stylized image [here](https://algorithmia.com/v1/data/<username>/DeepFilterTraining/stylized.jpg): (`https://algorithmia.com/v1/data/<username>/DeepFilterTraining/stylized.jpg`) (You need to be logged in, and need to change `<username>` with your login name.)
